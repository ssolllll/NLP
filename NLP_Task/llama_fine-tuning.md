1. **Loading the Dataset:**
   The first step involves loading the preprocessed dataset. This dataset will be used for fine-tuning. Preprocessing might involve reformatting prompts, filtering out low-quality text, and combining multiple datasets if needed.

2. **Configuring BitsAndBytes for 4-bit Quantization:**
   The `BitsAndBytesConfig` is set up to enable 4-bit quantization. This configuration is crucial for reducing the memory usage during fine-tuning.

3. **Loading Llama 2 Model and Tokenizer in 4-bit Precision:**
   The Llama 2 model is loaded with 4-bit precision, which significantly reduces the memory footprint. The corresponding tokenizer is also loaded to preprocess the text data.

4. **Loading Configurations and Initializing SFTTrainer:**
   - The configurations needed for QLoRA, which is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, are loaded.
   - Regular training parameters are set up.
   - The `SFTTrainer` is initialized with all the loaded configurations and parameters. This trainer will manage the supervised fine-tuning process.

5. **Start of Training:**
   After all the necessary components are loaded and configured, the training process begins. The `SFTTrainer` takes care of fine-tuning the Llama 2 model using the specified dataset, configurations, and parameters.
   
  These steps collectively set up the environment for fine-tuning a Llama 2 model with 7 billion parameters in 4-bit precision using the QLoRA technique, thus optimizing for VRAM limitations while maintaining model performance.
